Please use the Makefile to compile and run the code. I am using the Assimp library to read the stl file format.
On ubuntu, I installed this library from the ubuntu software center. For windows, the download instructions can
be found on the assimp website http://assimp.sourceforge.net/ 

The program takes around 15-20 min to calculate the distance field for both the upper jaw and the lower jaw.
Please use the following keys to change the scene:


w : move scene upwards
s : move scene downwards
a : move scene left
d : move scene right
k : zoom in
l : zoom out
t : move bear upwards
z : move bear downwards
g : move bear right
h : move bear left
b : move bear forward
n : move bear backward
